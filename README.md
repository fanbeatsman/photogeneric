Schizophrenic repository that originally contained a project itself, but also doubles as the root of my personal website. Thanks to django and its MVC, they are organizeed within the same directory with minimal conflict.

To run Django app on a local server:
```
python manage.py runserver *YOUR IP ADDRESS*:8080
```
